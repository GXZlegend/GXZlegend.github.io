I am a second-year Ph.D. student in software engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Mingsheng Long. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelors degree from Tsinghua University (Yao Class). In high school, I used to compete in Olympiad in Informatics (OI).

My research interests include diffusion models, predictive learning, AI for science, and transfer learning. I am working on developing an accurate, fine, and physically sound generative predictive model for world systems, such as meteorology and fluid physics. I also focus on foundational research in generative models such as diffusion models, especially in the context of transfer learning.
